# Tutoring-Booking-System-NEA
This is end product of a Non-Exam Assessment done for the Computer Science A-Level course. It is a demonstration of the idea I had for a tutoring booking system, hence it is not completely functional and only contains basic functions as I had a limited time frame for the project. 

I have referenced this Python web application tutorial by Tech with Tim for the foundation of this project, as I had no prior experience with the Flask framework. I have added different account types as well as database entry on top for the project. For the UI design, to reduce the hassle of having to code the whole page myself, I had used CSS and HTML code generated by ChatGPT after tweaking some minor details myself.
